# Heart-Disease-Prediction---Python

Predicting and diagnosing heart disease is the biggest challenge in the medical industry and relies on factors such as the physical examination, symptoms and signs of the patient.

Factors that influence heart disease are body cholesterol levels, smoking habit and obesity, family history of illnesses, blood pressure, and work environment. Machine learning algorithms play an essential and precise role in the prediction of heart disease.

Heart disease can be predicted based on various symptoms such as age, gender, heart rate, etc. and reduces the death rate of heart patients.Due to the increasing use of technology and data collection, we can now predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms.

I trained a model for the task of heart disease prediction using Machine Learning and I used the Logistic Regression algorithm to train the model.
