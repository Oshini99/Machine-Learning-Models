# Resume-Screening---Python

Hiring the right talent is a challenge for all businesses. This challenge is magnified by the high volume of applicants if the business is labour-intensive, growing, and facing high attrition rates. 
In a typical service organization, professionals with a variety of technical skills and business domain expertise are hired and assigned to projects to resolve customer issues. This task of selecting the best talent among many others is known as Resume Screening.
This includes a Machine Learning project on Resume Screening with Python programming language which can use to easily find the suitable person to hire.
